[04-11-2017] v0.06
UPDATES:
- v0.06 released on SA-MP forums (first release) http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?p=3950205
- Added GameTextForPlayer to warn them that their ping is high
- Fixed minor bugs like where GameTextForPlayer flashed for a split second after the player was unfrozen
TO-DO's:
- Change MAX_PING to WARN_PING. This will do the same things it usually does but I will add a new MAX_PING which will kick the user 
                                                                 e.g.
                                           #define WARN_PING 50 //normal stuff, player will be frozen
                                           #define MAX_PING 500 //player will get kicked if ping exceeds this value
                                           
- Define how much seconds the warning message will last for the player who is Ping Banned
- Fix any other bugs I come accross or are reported
